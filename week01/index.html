      <h2>Assumptions</h2>
  <p class="section">The first assumption I'm making is that you're using a standard sized X liter
        French Press. If you're using something different, then you'll need to adjust the
        amount of coffee. <a href=
        "http://www.algebrahelp.com/calculators/equation/proportions/"
           target="_blank">You can use this handy online proportion calculator if you
           need help.</a> <img src="images/password-meter-400.png" class="wrap"
             alt="password-meter-400"/></p>

        <p>The second assumption I'm making is that you like a reasonably strong cup of
        coffee. If you don't, you'll need to use less grounds and experiment to find your
        sweet spot.</p>
        <div id="step03" class="section">
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
          <p>To begin, you'll need to turn on your water-boiling device. Once you've done
          that, set your timer for 4 minutes BUT don't turn it on. You'll need it at a
          later step.</p>

        </div>
          <div id="step04" class="section">

          <h2>Measure Coffee</h2>
		  	<img src="images/2-measure.jpg" alt="2-measure" width="150" height="150" />
            <p>While you are waiting for the water to boil, you can set up the
            coffee.</p>Place the coffee press on the scale and zero it out. Then use the
            scoop to put ground coffee into your french press. You'll want to add 45
            grams of coffee for a strong, but drinkable brew. If you want a stronger or
            weaker brew, you make the necessary adjustments.

          </div>
            <div id="step05" class="section">
            <h2>Brew the coffee</h2>
              <img src="images/3-brew.jpg" alt="3-brew" width="150" height="150" />
              <p>Once the water hits the boiling point, begin by pouring approximately a
              1 cup of water into the press and stir so that there are no pockets of
              grounds. Once it's all stirred up, continue to pour water up to the fill
              line. Once you've done that, place the cap back on the French Press and
              start the timer.</p>

            </div>
              <div id="step06" class="section">

              <h2>Finish the coffee</h2>
              <img src="images/4-press.jpg" alt="4-press" width="150" height="150" />
<img src="images/5-pour.jpg" alt="5-pour" width="150" height="150" />
              <p>After the timer goes off, push the plunger down. There is no rush to
                do it, so take your time and don't splash scalding coffee all over the
                place. Once the plunge is all the way at the bottom, pour the coffee into
                the cups. You'll want to pour all of the coffee into the cups, as the
                unused portion will continue to brew, get strong and more bitter.</p>
