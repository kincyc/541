        <h1>Positioning</h1>
        <p>Position the interpreter by your side (or even a step back). The ideal placement is between you and the target. This will keep the subject or audience from shifting their attention, or fixating on the interpreter.</p>
        <p>Always look at and talk directly to the subject or audience.</p>
				<p>Don't talk to the interpreter.</p>
				<p>this diagram shows the ideal placement for you, the target and the interpreter. Obviously your conditions may vary, but this is what you should try for.</p>

        <h2>Speaking Style</h2>
        <p>Speak slowly and clearly. Repeat as often as necessary.</p>
        <p>Do not address the subject or audience in the third person through the interpreter. Avoid saying, "tell them I'm glad to be their instructor," rather say, "I'm glad to be your instructor."
        Address the subject or audience directly.</p>
        <p>Speak to the individual or group as if they understand English. Be enthusiastic and employ the gestures, movements, voice intonations, and inflections that would normally be used before an
        English-speaking group.</p>
