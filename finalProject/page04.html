				<h1>Verbal Techniques</h1>
<p>An important first step in communicating in a foreign language is to polish personal English language skills. This is true even if no attempt is made to learn the indigenous language. The clearer the peacekeeper’s English, including diction, the easier it is for the interpreter to translate.</p> 
<p>Other factors to consider include use of slang, and colloquialisms or military jargon. In many cases, such expressions cannot be translated. Even those that can be translated do not always retain the desired meaning. Examples such as "Gee Whiz" or "Golly" are hard to translate. In addition, if a using a technical term or expression, be sure the interpreter conveys the proper meaning in the target language. Speak in low context, simple sentences. For instance, the military member may want to add words usually left off such as “air” plane. This ensures the meaning will be obvious, and not talking about the Great Plains or a wood plane.</p>
<p>Do not use profanity! Many people are familiar with American profanity and they will often take it literally. Also, make sure your interpreter is not using profanity when translating back to you. Many terps learn bad habits from US servicemembers and can really offend your targets</p>
<p>When you're speaking off the cuff, think about what to say, break it down into logical bits, and give it out a small piece at a time. Use short, simple words and sentences and low context, for quick and easy translation. As a rule of thumb, never say more in one sentence than the interpreter can easily repeat word for word immediately after saying it. Each sentence should contain a complete thought.</p>
<p>Transitional phrases and qualifiers tend to confuse and waste valuable time, so use them sparingly. Examples are "for example," "in most cases," "maybe," "perhaps," etc. Be cautious of using American humor. Cultural and language differences can lead to misinterpretations by foreigners. The peacekeeper should determine early on what the interpreter finds easiest to understand and translate meaningfully.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Remember - your target(s) may not have experience using interpreters. While you can't correct their word usage or choices, you can control the tempo. Make sure they aren't rambling paragraph after paragraph without giving your terp a chance to translate what's being said. Id you don't manage this, you will lose a lot of information. Politely cut them off and ask your terp to translate. Make sure your terp is aware that he can also manage this flow</p>

<p>Use the audio player to hear a short example of these technique, in particular how to break things down. It does seem "dumbed down" - however, this will make it much easier for your interpreter to interpret. Don't worry about offending because it seems like you're talking to a kindergartner. They know you don't speak their language and they will appreciate being able to clearly understand what you're saying</p>
