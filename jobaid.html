<h1>Assumptions</h1>

	how much coffee
	strength of coffee


gather the supplies

	french press
	ground coffee
	scoop
	scale
	some way of boiling water
	timer
	spoon that is long enough reaching into the french press
	cup(s) for drinking the coffee. You want enough capacity to hold all the coffee you're going to brew

Preparation

	Start boiling heat water
	Set timer to 4 minutes, but don't start

measure coffee

	place press on scale and zero it out
	add coffee until it hits 45 grams
	remove coffee from scale
	
	
Brew the coffee
	
	When the water is boiling, pour approximately a cup of water into the press and stir so that there are no pockets of grounds.
	once it's all stirred, add the remaining water to the fill line
	place cap on the french press
	start timer
	
Finish the coffee

	After the timer goes off, push the plunge down. There is no rush to do it, so take your time and don't splash scalding coffee all over the place
	once the plunge is all the way at the bottom, pour the coffee into the cups. You should pour all of the coffee; if you leave any in the press, it will continue to brew and just get stronger and more bitter.
