<h1>A Confidential Response</h1>
<p>Dear <span style="text-transform:capitalize;" id="firstName"></span>,</p>

<p>Thank you for your prompt response to my urgent plea and the content therein are noted. I must confess to you that I did not choose you but I just tried you. I did not send this proposal to you alone, it was sent to seventeen other people that are sharing the effervescent learning experience known as MIST 541. Since you are the first to contact me, I will want us to do this together. Therefore, if you are willing and able to handle this transaction,  below the initial steps of the process.</p>
<p>Firstly you should provide your private telephone and fax numbers as well as your banking particulars. Also, please validate your email address. I will need to have use of this information to apply for the claim and send to you the said sum of $31million.</p>

<form action="final.html">

<table width=600px>
	<tr>
		<td width="50%"><strong>Email</strong></td>
		<td><input type="text" size="25" id="email" /><br></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="50%">Telephone Number</td>
		<td><input type="text" size="25" id="tel" /><br></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="50%">Fax Number</td>
		<td><input type="text" size="25" id="fax" /><br></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong><span style="text-transform:capitalize;" id="bankName"></span></strong> Account Number</td>
		<td><input type="text" size="25" id="account" /><br></td>
	</tr>

</table>

<p>After the letters of claims have been sent to the bank we will then obtain approvals from all the departments that are consigned for the final remittance of the fund into your account. Please note that you will need to formally claim the funds as a Company DIRECTOR of <strong><span style="text-transform:capitalize;" id="company"></span></strong>.</p>

<p>Please note that this transaction will be concluded within 10 bank working days from the day I am in receipt of the above information. Remember that this transaction must be kept in utmost confidentiality and top secret.</p>
<p>I await your prompt response.</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>
